### Summary

I don't know everything and I'm not scared to admit that. I think this is one of the most important soft skill nowadays cause, the world and technology are in constant evolution and everything can change in one night. This is scary but I like.

### Projects


| Company | Project Name | Year |
| :-------| :---------- | :-----|
| Kroton | TFS operation | 2017 - 2018|

TFS (Teams Foundation Services) was the predecessor of Azure Devops. It's different because it is on-premises. I was part of the teams that was responsible for maintain and evolve TFS services for the entire compnay.

In this project I learned about Development Lifecycle, Git, SQL Server, Windows Server and more.

| Kroton | Azure DevOps Setup and Run | 2018 - 2019|

In this project I helped a squad called **System Team** to migrate, setup, build and run hundreds of applications. We had **Infrastrucutre as Code**, **Backend Microservices** and **Web Applications**. We had the challenge of help agile teams to deliver software more reliable, resilient and fast. At the time, we were using Azure Cloud services. Microsoft was sponsoring this project.

I also participate in a development of a web application that, with just a few clicks, a developer would have a CI and CD pipeline ready to run with all the configurations setup. 

This project was my career platform. I learned a lot with very good professionals and learned cool stuff about cloud services and Microsoft Azure.

| ESX | Azure DevOps and Azure Operations | 2019 - 2020|

ESX is a Brazilian company that provides consultancy and operational services for its clients. I was part of a team that was working with a client from insurance business that already had Azure Devops CI and CD pipelines running. I was responsable for service a squad that was building the most digital and disruptive plataform for insurance brokers. I helped them to migrate a PHP Laravel backend to Azure App Services. 

It was all from scratch. Their needs demanded from me to create a complete customized CI and CD pipeline for their applications. This project was really challenging cause  I was replacing an engineer that decided to resign this project.

So, I started a process to recover the client trust that our company could achive their expactations and deliver the project. Said and done. In 2 months, the client was happy, the project was almost delivered and, the most important, I grew up as a better professional

| Itau Unibanco | First Consortium mobile feature | 2020 - 2021|

In this project I was working as a Full-Stack Developer. My team was creating the first pages of a mobile feature for the bank clients that wanted to simulate a consortium. Here, we are using Angular to develop the frontend and Java for the backend. I've never worked as a developer before, so it was nice for my career be in this role.

| Itau Unibanco | Tech Lead | 2021 - Current|

As a Tech lead at Itau Unibanco, we are responsible for the team delivery, architect high resilient and scalable solutions, build and run application in production workloads and much more.

Here I'm developing my soft skills and leadership skills. I need to understand business needs, design a good solution using AWS services and translate all to my team. In this project I need to have a view of the whole. From my Junior having trouble to setup his dev environment to my business manager and my Tech manager asking me about schedule and delivery forecast. Handle these situations and balance everything is have been my daily challenge. 

But, as I say in the **Summary**, I don't know everything and I'm not scare to admit that
